# Employment-Landscape-in-Singapore-1998-2020

In this project, I set out to identify how the fast pace of economic growth in Singapore has changed its employment landscape over the past 22 years, delving into an analysis of employment metrics across occupational groups.

## Summary of findings

### How has the employment landscape in Singapore changed?

We have seen a boom in the job market in Singapore since 2005, especially in the services industry. The gap between the vacancies available in the services industry versus the other industries have been widening but has started to slow down since 2015.
The occupations professionals, managers, executives, and technicians was not affected by the slowdown, and continues on an upward trend even during the COVID19 pandemic. This showcases the resiliance of these job groups, which typically require higher levels of education than the other occupational groups.
We see a shift towards greater job stability for permanent employees in the construction industry and with the productions and transport operators, cleaners, and labourers occupational group since 2016.


### How has historical global economic crisis affected the landscape of jobs in Singapore?

The different economic crisis had different level on impacts on the different industries and occupational groups. Employment in the manufacturing industry took the biggest hit from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, with retrenchment rates at its peak. It was also relatively affected by the 2009 financial crisis. Nevertheless, COVID19 had minimal impact retrenchment volumes in the industry.
Employment in the services industry took the biggest hit from COVID19, reaching its highest retrenchment volumes in 30 years.
Recruitment rates among all occupational groups has historically been affected by the global economic climate, which backs up the hypothesis that Singapore's job market is heavily reliant on global economic conditions.
Finally, it was observed that resignation rates are generally stable, but can see large shifts during both market confidence and fear.
